# Upgrade Script

> for work only

Each time the leader release the [vue-sfc-cli](https://github.com/femessage/vue-sfc-cli)

I need to upgrade all currently components to the cli latest version.

So I made this script to reduce my work.

## Stacks

- `child_process`
- `hub`

## Why not shell?

I can't.
